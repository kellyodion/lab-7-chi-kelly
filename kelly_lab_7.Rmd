```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I'm Kelly and I'm updating this markdown file

Load packages and data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

gc <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")
```

Is there a signficant difference in recommended gun control action in male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)? 



Hey
