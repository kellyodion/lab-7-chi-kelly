```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I'm Kelly and I'm updating this markdown file

Load packages and data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

gc <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")
```

Is there a signficant difference in recommended gun control action in male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)? 



Hey

Kelly: data wrangling and counts 

```{r}
get_guns <- gc %>% 
  filter(gender!= "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns)


```
